646. Maximum Length of Pair Chain 
---------------------------------


 You are given n pairs of numbers. In every pair, the first number is always smaller than the second number.

Now, we define a pair (c, d) can follow another pair (a, b) if and only if b < c. Chain of pairs can be formed in this fashion.

Given a set of pairs, find the length longest chain which can be formed. You needn't use up all the given pairs. You can select pairs in any order.

Example 1:

Input: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest chain is [1,2] -> [3,4]

Note:

    The number of given pairs will be in the range [1, 1000].


638. Shopping Offers 
--------------------

 In LeetCode Store, there are some kinds of items to sell. Each item has a price.

However, there are some special offers, and a special offer consists of one or more different kinds of items with a sale price.

You are given the each item's price, a set of special offers, and the number we need to buy for each item. The job is to output the lowest price you have to pay for exactly certain items as given, where you could make optimal use of the special offers.

Each special offer is represented in the form of an array, the last number represents the price you need to pay for this special offer, other numbers represents how many specific items you could get if you buy this offer.

You could use any of special offers as many times as you want.

Example 1:

Input: [2,5], [[3,0,5],[1,2,10]], [3,2]
Output: 14
Explanation: 
There are two kinds of items, A and B. Their prices are $2 and $5 respectively. 
In special offer 1, you can pay $5 for 3A and 0B
In special offer 2, you can pay $10 for 1A and 2B. 
You need to buy 3A and 2B, so you may pay $10 for 1A and 2B (special offer #2), and $4 for 2A.

Example 2:

Input: [2,3,4], [[1,1,0,4],[2,2,1,9]], [1,2,1]
Output: 11
Explanation: 
The price of A is $2, and $3 for B, $4 for C. 
You may pay $4 for 1A and 1B, and $9 for 2A ,2B and 1C. 
You need to buy 1A ,2B and 1C, so you may pay $4 for 1A and 1B (special offer #1), and $3 for 1B, $4 for 1C. 
You cannot add more items, though only $9 for 2A ,2B and 1C.

Note:

    There are at most 6 kinds of items, 100 special offers.
    For each item, you need to buy at most 6 of them.
    You are not allowed to buy more items than you want, even if that would lower the overall price.


576. Out of Boundary Paths 
--------------------------


There is an m by n grid with a ball. Given the start coordinate (i,j) of the ball, you can move the ball to adjacent cell or cross the grid boundary in four directions (up, down, left, right). However, you can at most move N times. Find out the number of paths to move the ball out of grid boundary. The answer may be very large, return it after mod 109 + 7.

Example 1:

Input:m = 2, n = 2, N = 2, i = 0, j = 0
Output: 6
Explanation:

Example 2:

Input:m = 1, n = 3, N = 3, i = 0, j = 1
Output: 12
Explanation:

Note:

    Once you move the ball out of boundary, you cannot move it back.
    The length and height of the grid is in range [1,50].
    N is in range [0,50].



523. Continuous Subarray Sum
----------------------------


 Given a list of non-negative numbers and a target integer k, write a function to check if the array has a continuous subarray of size at least 2 that sums up to the multiple of k, that is, sums up to n*k where n is also an integer.

Example 1:

Input: [23, 2, 4, 6, 7],  k=6
Output: True
Explanation: Because [2, 4] is a continuous subarray of size 2 and sums up to 6.

Example 2:

Input: [23, 2, 6, 4, 7],  k=6
Output: True
Explanation: Because [23, 2, 6, 4, 7] is an continuous subarray of size 5 and sums up to 42.

Note:

    The length of the array won't exceed 10,000.
    You may assume the sum of all the numbers is in the range of a signed 32-bit integer.

516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence 
------------------------------------



 Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Example 1:
Input:

"bbbab"

Output:

4

One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".

Example 2:
Input:

"cbbd"

Output:

2

One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb". 



494. Target Sum 
---------------
 You are given a list of non-negative integers, a1, a2, ..., an, and a target, S. Now you have 2 symbols + and -. For each integer, you should choose one from + and - as its new symbol.

Find out how many ways to assign symbols to make sum of integers equal to target S.

Example 1:

Input: nums is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], S is 3. 
Output: 5
Explanation: 

-1+1+1+1+1 = 3
+1-1+1+1+1 = 3
+1+1-1+1+1 = 3
+1+1+1-1+1 = 3
+1+1+1+1-1 = 3

There are 5 ways to assign symbols to make the sum of nums be target 3.

Note:

    The length of the given array is positive and will not exceed 20.
    The sum of elements in the given array will not exceed 1000.
    Your output answer is guaranteed to be fitted in a 32-bit integer.

486. Predict the Winner 
-----------------------

Given an array of scores that are non-negative integers. Player 1 picks one of the numbers from either end of the array followed by the player 2 and then player 1 and so on. Each time a player picks a number, that number will not be available for the next player. This continues until all the scores have been chosen. The player with the maximum score wins.

Given an array of scores, predict whether player 1 is the winner. You can assume each player plays to maximize his score.

Example 1:

Input: [1, 5, 2]
Output: False
Explanation: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2. 
If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2). 
So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5. 
Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return False.

Example 2:

Input: [1, 5, 233, 7]
Output: True
Explanation: Player 1 first chooses 1. Then player 2 have to choose between 5 and 7. No matter which number player 2 choose, player 1 can choose 233.
Finally, player 1 has more score (234) than player 2 (12), so you need to return True representing player1 can win.

Note:

    1 <= length of the array <= 20.
    Any scores in the given array are non-negative integers and will not exceed 10,000,000.
    If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner.




474. Ones and Zeroes 
--------------------


In the computer world, use restricted resource you have to generate maximum benefit is what we always want to pursue.

For now, suppose you are a dominator of m 0s and n 1s respectively. On the other hand, there is an array with strings consisting of only 0s and 1s.

Now your task is to find the maximum number of strings that you can form with given m 0s and n 1s. Each 0 and 1 can be used at most once.

Note:

    The given numbers of 0s and 1s will both not exceed 100
    The size of given string array won't exceed 600.

Example 1:

Input: Array = {"10", "0001", "111001", "1", "0"}, m = 5, n = 3
Output: 4

Explanation: This are totally 4 strings can be formed by the using of 5 0s and 3 1s, which are “10,”0001”,”1”,”0”

Example 2:

Input: Array = {"10", "0", "1"}, m = 1, n = 1
Output: 2

Explanation: You could form "10", but then you'd have nothing left. Better form "0" and "1".

467. Unique Substrings in Wraparound String
-------------------------------------------

Consider the string s to be the infinite wraparound string of "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", so s will look like this: "...zabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcd....".

Now we have another string p. Your job is to find out how many unique non-empty substrings of p are present in s. In particular, your input is the string p and you need to output the number of different non-empty substrings of p in the string s.

Note: p consists of only lowercase English letters and the size of p might be over 10000.

Example 1:

Input: "a"
Output: 1

Explanation: Only the substring "a" of string "a" is in the string s.

Example 2:

Input: "cac"
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two substrings "a", "c" of string "cac" in the string s.

Example 3:

Input: "zab"
Output: 6
Explanation: There are six substrings "z", "a", "b", "za", "ab", "zab" of string "zab" in the string s.

464. Can I Win
--------------

In the "100 game," two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from 1..10. The player who first causes the running total to reach or exceed 100 wins.

What if we change the game so that players cannot re-use integers?

For example, two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers of 1..15 without replacement until they reach a total >= 100.

Given an integer maxChoosableInteger and another integer desiredTotal, determine if the first player to move can force a win, assuming both players play optimally.

You can always assume that maxChoosableInteger will not be larger than 20 and desiredTotal will not be larger than 300.

Example

Input:
maxChoosableInteger = 10
desiredTotal = 11

Output:
false

Explanation:
No matter which integer the first player choose, the first player will lose.
The first player can choose an integer from 1 up to 10.
If the first player choose 1, the second player can only choose integers from 2 up to 10.
The second player will win by choosing 10 and get a total = 11, which is >= desiredTotal.
Same with other integers chosen by the first player, the second player will always win.
