536. Construct Binary Tree from String
--------------------------------------
You need to construct a binary tree from a string consisting of parenthesis and integers.

The whole input represents a binary tree. It contains an integer followed by zero, one or two pairs of parenthesis. The integer represents the root's value and a pair of parenthesis contains a child binary tree with the same structure.

You always start to construct the left child node of the parent first if it exists.

Example:

Input: "4(2(3)(1))(6(5))"
Output: return the tree root node representing the following tree:

       4
     /   \
    2     6
   / \   / 
  3   1 5   
Note:

There will only be '(', ')', '-' and '0' ~ '9' in the input string.

题目大意：
根据字符串重构二叉树。

输入包含数字和括号，数字代表根节点，括号内的子串代表左、右孩子。

注意：

输入字符串只包含'(', ')，'-'和数字'0'-'9'

解题思路：
递归+字符串处理

通过括号匹配将字符串拆解成root, (left), (right)三部分，递归创建二叉树

3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters 
-------------------------------------------------

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Examples:

Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.

Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.


5. Longest Palindromic Substring
--------------------------------


Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Example:

Input: "babad"

Output: "bab"

Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
Example:

Input: "cbbd"

Output: "bb"


17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number 
-----------------------------------------

Given a digit string, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent.

A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below.

Input:Digit string "23"
Output: ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"].

Note:
Although the above answer is in lexicographical order, your answer could be in any order you want.
