687. Longest Univalue Path 
--------------------------
Given a binary tree, find the length of the longest path where each node in the path has the same value. This path may or may not pass through the root.

Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

Example 1:
:: 
        Input:

                      5
                     / \
                    4   5
                   / \   \
                  1   1   5

        Output: 2

Example 2:
::
        Input:

                      1
                     / \
                    4   5
                   / \   \
                  4   4   5

        Output: 2

Note: The given binary tree has not more than 10000 nodes. The height of the tree is not more than 1000.

                if root is None: return 0
                l = self._univaluePath(root.left) if root.left is not None else -1
                r = self._univaluePath(root.right) if root.right is not None else -1
                pl = l + 1 if l >= 0 and root.val == root.left.val else 0
                pr = r + 1 if r >= 0 and root.val == root.right.val else 0
                self.ans = max(self.ans, pl + pr)
                return max(pl, pr)




671. Second Minimum Node In a Binary Tree
-----------------------------------------


 Given a non-empty special binary tree consisting of nodes with the non-negative value, where each node in this tree has exactly two or zero sub-node. If the node has two sub-nodes, then this node's value is the smaller value among its two sub-nodes.

Given such a binary tree, you need to output the second minimum value in the set made of all the nodes' value in the whole tree.

If no such second minimum value exists, output -1 instead.

Example 1:
:: 
        Input: 
            2
           / \
          2   5
             / \
            5   7

        Output: 5
        Explanation: The smallest value is 2, the second smallest value is 5.

Example 2:
::
        Input: 
            2
           / \
          2   2

        Output: -1
        Explanation: The smallest value is 2, but there isn't any second smallest value.

669. Trim a Binary Search Tree 
------------------------------

Given a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as L and R, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in [L, R] (R >= L). You might need to change the root of the tree, so the result should return the new root of the trimmed binary search tree.

Example 1:
:: 
        Input: 
            1
           / \
          0   2

          L = 1
          R = 2

        Output: 
            1
              \
               2

Example 2:
::
        Input: 
            3
           / \
          0   4
           \
            2
           /
          1

          L = 1
          R = 3

        Output: 
              3
             / 
           2   
          /
         1

653. Two Sum IV - Input is a BST 
--------------------------------

Given a Binary Search Tree and a target number, return true if there exist two elements in the BST such that their sum is equal to the given target.

Example 1:
:: 
        Input: 
            5
           / \
          3   6
         / \   \
        2   4   7

        Target = 9

        Output: True

Example 2:
::
        Input: 
            5
           / \
          3   6
         / \   \
        2   4   7

        Target = 28

        Output: False


637. Average of Levels in Binary Tree 
-------------------------------------


Given a non-empty binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array.

Example 1:
::
        Input:
            3
           / \
          9  20
            /  \
           15   7
        Output: [3, 14.5, 11]
        Explanation:
        The average value of nodes on level 0 is 3,  on level 1 is 14.5, and on level 2 is 11. Hence return [3, 14.5, 11].

Note:

    The range of node's value is in the range of 32-bit signed integer.

617. Merge Two Binary Trees 
---------------------------


 Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not.

You need to merge them into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of new tree.

Example 1:

Input: 
    Tree 1                     Tree 2                  
          1                         2                             
         / \                       / \                            
        3   2                     1   3                        
       /                           \   \                      
      5                             4   7                  
Output: 
Merged tree:
         3
        / \
       4   5
      / \   \ 
     5   4   7

Note: The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees. 



606. Construct String from Binary Tree 
--------------------------------------


You need to construct a string consists of parenthesis and integers from a binary tree with the preorder traversing way.

The null node needs to be represented by empty parenthesis pair "()". And you need to omit all the empty parenthesis pairs that don't affect the one-to-one mapping relationship between the string and the original binary tree.

Example 1:

Input: Binary tree: [1,2,3,4]
       1
     /   \
    2     3
   /    
  4     

Output: "1(2(4))(3)"

Explanation: Originallay it needs to be "1(2(4)())(3()())", 
but you need to omit all the unnecessary empty parenthesis pairs. 
And it will be "1(2(4))(3)".

Example 2:

Input: Binary tree: [1,2,3,null,4]
       1
     /   \
    2     3
     \  
      4 

Output: "1(2()(4))(3)"

Explanation: Almost the same as the first example, 
except we can't omit the first parenthesis pair to break the one-to-one mapping relationship between the input and the output.

572. Subtree of Another Tree 
----------------------------

 Given two non-empty binary trees s and t, check whether tree t has exactly the same structure and node values with a subtree of s. A subtree of s is a tree consists of a node in s and all of this node's descendants. The tree s could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

Example 1:
Given tree s:

     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \
 1   2

Given tree t:

   4 
  / \
 1   2

Return true, because t has the same structure and node values with a subtree of s.

Example 2:
Given tree s:

     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \
 1   2
    /
   0

Given tree t:

   4
  / \
 1   2

Return false. 



563. Binary Tree Tilt 
---------------------

Given a binary tree, return the tilt of the whole tree.

The tilt of a tree node is defined as the absolute difference between the sum of all left subtree node values and the sum of all right subtree node values. Null node has tilt 0.

The tilt of the whole tree is defined as the sum of all nodes' tilt.

Example:

Input: 
         1
       /   \
      2     3
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Tilt of node 2 : 0
Tilt of node 3 : 0
Tilt of node 1 : |2-3| = 1
Tilt of binary tree : 0 + 0 + 1 = 1

Note:

    The sum of node values in any subtree won't exceed the range of 32-bit integer.
    All the tilt values won't exceed the range of 32-bit integer.



543. Diameter of Binary Tree 
----------------------------

Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

Example:
Given a binary tree

          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    

Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them. 


538. Convert BST to Greater Tree 
--------------------------------


Given a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.

Example:
::
        Input: The root of a Binary Search Tree like this:
                      5
                    /   \
                   2     13

        Output: The root of a Greater Tree like this:
                     18
                    /   \
                  20     13


501. Find Mode in Binary Search Tree
------------------------------------

Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the mode(s) (the most frequently occurred element) in the given BST.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

    The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
    The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
    Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

For example:
Given BST [1,null,2,2],

   1
    \
     2
    /
   2

return [2].

Note: If a tree has more than one mode, you can return them in any order.

Follow up: Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count). 



437. Path Sum III 
-----------------


You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value.

Find the number of paths that sum to a given value.

The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

The tree has no more than 1,000 nodes and the values are in the range -1,000,000 to 1,000,000.

Example:
::
        root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], sum = 8

              10
             /  \
            5   -3
           / \    \
          3   2   11
         / \   \
        3  -2   1

        Return 3. The paths that sum to 8 are:

        1.  5 -> 3
        2.  5 -> 2 -> 1
        3. -3 -> 11


404. Sum of Left Leaves
-----------------------


Find the sum of all left leaves in a given binary tree.

Example:
::
        3
       / \
      9  20
        /  \
       15   7

    There are two left leaves in the binary tree, with values 9 and 15 respectively. Return 24.






270. Closest Binary Search Tree Value
-------------------------------------

Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find the value in the BST that is closest to the target.
Note:
Given target value is a floating point.
You are guaranteed to have only one unique value in the BST that is closest to the target.

递归法
复杂度
时间 O(logN) 空间 O(H)

思路
根据二叉树的性质，我们知道当遍历到某个根节点时，最近的那个节点要么是在子树里面，要么就是根节点本身。所以我们根据这个递归，返回子树中最近的节点，和根节点中更近的那个就行了。

迭代法
复杂度
时间 O(logN) 空间 O(H)

思路
记录一个最近的值，然后沿着二叉搜索的路径一路比较下去，并更新这个最近值就行了。因为我们知道离目标数最接近的数肯定在二叉搜索的路径上。


Closest Binary Search Tree Value II
-----------------------------------

Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find k values in the BST that are closest to the target.

Note: Given target value is a floating point. You may assume k is always valid, that is: k ≤ total nodes. You are guaranteed to have only one unique set of k values in the BST that are closest to the target. Follow up: Assume that the BST is balanced, could you solve it in less than O(n) runtime (where n = total nodes)?

Hint:

Consider implement these two helper functions: getPredecessor(N), which returns the next smaller node to N. getSuccessor(N), which returns the next larger node to N.


中序遍历法
复杂度
时间 O(N) 空间 Max(O(K),O(H))

思路
二叉搜索树的中序遍历就是顺序输出二叉搜索树，所以我们只要中序遍历二叉搜索树，同时维护一个大小为K的队列，前K个数直接加入队列，之后每来一个新的数（较大的数），如果该数和目标的差，相比于队头的数离目标的差来说，更小，则将队头拿出来，将新数加入队列。如果该数的差更大，则直接退出并返回这个队列，因为后面的数更大，差值也只会更大。




257. Binary Tree Paths 
----------------------

Given a binary tree, return all root-to-leaf paths.

For example, given the following binary tree:

   1
 /   \
2     3
 \
  5

All root-to-leaf paths are:

["1->2->5", "1->3"]


235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree 
---------------------------------------------------


 Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
::
        _______6______
       /              \
    ___2__          ___8__
   /      \        /      \
   0      _4       7       9
         /  \
         3   5

For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 2 and 8 is 6. Another example is LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.


226. Invert Binary Tree 
-----------------------

::
        Invert a binary tree.

             4
           /   \
          2     7
         / \   / \
        1   3 6   9

        to

             4
           /   \
          7     2
         / \   / \
        9   6 3   1



112. Path Sum
-------------

Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.
For example:
::

        Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,

                      5
                     / \
                    4   8
                   /   / \
                  11  13  4
                 /  \      \
                7    2      1

        return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path 5->4->11->2 which sum is 22.



111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree
---------------------------------


Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.



110. Balanced Binary Tree 
-------------------------


Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1. 




108. Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree
-----------------------------------------------


Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.




107. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II
-----------------------------------------



Given a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).
::
For example:
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7

return its bottom-up level order traversal as:

[
  [15,7],
  [9,20],
  [3]
]


104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
---------------------------------


Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.




101. Symmetric Tree
-------------------

Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:

    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3

But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:

    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3

Note:
Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively. 


100. Same Tree
--------------

Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are equal or not.

Two binary trees are considered equal if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value. 



684. Redundant Connection
-------------------------

 In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.

The given input is a graph that started as a tree with N nodes (with distinct values 1, 2, ..., N), with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to N, and was not an edge that already existed.

The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of edges. Each element of edges is a pair [u, v] with u < v, that represents an undirected edge connecting nodes u and v.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of N nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array. The answer edge [u, v] should be in the same format, with u < v.

Example 1:

Input: [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
Explanation: The given undirected graph will be like this:
  1
 / \
2 - 3

Example 2:

Input: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,4], [1,5]]
Output: [1,4]
Explanation: The given undirected graph will be like this:
5 - 1 - 2
    |   |
    4 - 3

Note:
The size of the input 2D-array will be between 3 and 1000.
Every integer represented in the 2D-array will be between 1 and N, where N is the size of the input array.



666. Path Sum IV
----------------


If the depth of a tree is smaller than 5, then this tree can be represented by a list of three-digits integers.

For each integer in this list:

The hundreds digit represents the depth D of this node, 1 <= D <= 4.
The tens digit represents the position P of this node in the level it belongs to, 1 <= P <= 8. The position is the same as that in a full binary tree.
The units digit represents the value V of this node, 0 <= V <= 9.
Given a list of ascending three-digits integers representing a binary with the depth smaller than 5. You need to return the sum of all paths from the root towards the leaves.

Example 1:

Input: [113, 215, 221]
Output: 12
Explanation: 
The tree that the list represents is:
    3
   / \
  5   1

The path sum is (3 + 5) + (3 + 1) = 12.
Example 2:

Input: [113, 221]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The tree that the list represents is: 
    3
     \
      1

The path sum is (3 + 1) = 4.

663. Equal Tree Partition
-------------------------


Given a binary tree with n nodes, your task is to check if it's possible to partition the tree to two trees which have the equal sum of values after removing exactly one edge on the original tree.

Example 1:

Input:     
    5
   / \
  10 10
    /  \
   2   3

Output: True
Explanation: 
    5
   / 
  10
      
Sum: 15

   10
  /  \
 2    3

Sum: 15
Example 2:

685. Redundant Connection II 
----------------------------


 In this problem, a rooted tree is a directed graph such that, there is exactly one node (the root) for which all other nodes are descendants of this node, plus every node has exactly one parent, except for the root node which has no parents.

The given input is a directed graph that started as a rooted tree with N nodes (with distinct values 1, 2, ..., N), with one additional directed edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to N, and was not an edge that already existed.

The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of edges. Each element of edges is a pair [u, v] that represents a directed edge connecting nodes u and v, where u is a parent of child v.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a rooted tree of N nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array.

Example 1:

Input: [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
Explanation: The given directed graph will be like this:
  1
 / \
v   v
2-->3

Example 2:

Input: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [4,1], [1,5]]
Output: [4,1]
Explanation: The given directed graph will be like this:
5 <- 1 -> 2
     ^    |
     |    v
     4 <- 3

Note:
The size of the input 2D-array will be between 3 and 1000.
Every integer represented in the 2D-array will be between 1 and N, where N is the size of the input array.




662. Maximum Width of Binary Tree
---------------------------------

Given a binary tree, write a function to get the maximum width of the given tree. The width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels. The binary tree has the same structure as a full binary tree, but some nodes are null.

The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and right most non-null nodes in the level, where the null nodes between the end-nodes are also counted into the length calculation.

Example 1:

Input: 

           1
         /   \
        3     2
       / \     \  
      5   3     9 

Output: 4
Explanation: The maximum width existing in the third level with the length 4 (5,3,null,9).

Example 2:

Input: 

          1
         /  
        3    
       / \       
      5   3     

Output: 2
Explanation: The maximum width existing in the third level with the length 2 (5,3).

Example 3:

Input: 

          1
         / \
        3   2 
       /        
      5      

Output: 2
Explanation: The maximum width existing in the second level with the length 2 (3,2).

Example 4:

Input: 

          1
         / \
        3   2
       /     \  
      5       9 
     /         \
    6           7
Output: 8
Explanation:The maximum width existing in the fourth level with the length 8 (6,null,null,null,null,null,null,7).


Note: Answer will in the range of 32-bit signed integer. 



655. Print Binary Tree
----------------------


Print a binary tree in an m*n 2D string array following these rules:

    The row number m should be equal to the height of the given binary tree.
    The column number n should always be an odd number.
    The root node's value (in string format) should be put in the exactly middle of the first row it can be put. The column and the row where the root node belongs will separate the rest space into two parts (left-bottom part and right-bottom part). You should print the left subtree in the left-bottom part and print the right subtree in the right-bottom part. The left-bottom part and the right-bottom part should have the same size. Even if one subtree is none while the other is not, you don't need to print anything for the none subtree but still need to leave the space as large as that for the other subtree. However, if two subtrees are none, then you don't need to leave space for both of them.
    Each unused space should contain an empty string "".
    Print the subtrees following the same rules.

Example 1:

Input:
     1
    /
   2
Output:
[["", "1", ""],
 ["2", "", ""]]

Example 2:

Input:
     1
    / \
   2   3
    \
     4
Output:
[["", "", "", "1", "", "", ""],
 ["", "2", "", "", "", "3", ""],
 ["", "", "4", "", "", "", ""]]

Example 3:

Input:
      1
     / \
    2   5
   / 
  3 
 / 
4 
Output:

[["",  "",  "", "",  "", "", "", "1", "",  "",  "",  "",  "", "", ""]
 ["",  "",  "", "2", "", "", "", "",  "",  "",  "",  "5", "", "", ""]
 ["",  "3", "", "",  "", "", "", "",  "",  "",  "",  "",  "", "", ""]
 ["4", "",  "", "",  "", "", "", "",  "",  "",  "",  "",  "", "", ""]]

Note: The height of binary tree is in the range of [1, 10]. 




654. Maximum Binary Tree
------------------------

 Given an integer array with no duplicates. A maximum tree building on this array is defined as follow:

    The root is the maximum number in the array.
    The left subtree is the maximum tree constructed from left part subarray divided by the maximum number.
    The right subtree is the maximum tree constructed from right part subarray divided by the maximum number.

Construct the maximum tree by the given array and output the root node of this tree.

Example 1:

Input: [3,2,1,6,0,5]
Output: return the tree root node representing the following tree:

      6
    /   \
   3     5
    \    / 
     2  0   
       \
        1

Note:

    The size of the given array will be in the range [1,1000].


652. Find Duplicate Subtrees
----------------------------

Given a binary tree, return all duplicate subtrees. For each kind of duplicate subtrees, you only need to return the root node of any one of them.

Two trees are duplicate if they have the same structure with same node values.

Example 1: 
        1
       / \
      2   3
     /   / \
    4   2   4
       /
      4
The following are two duplicate subtrees:
      2
     /
    4
and
    4
Therefore, you need to return above trees' root in the form of a list.



623. Add One Row to Tree
------------------------




Given the root of a binary tree, then value v and depth d, you need to add a row of nodes with value v at the given depth d. The root node is at depth 1.

The adding rule is: given a positive integer depth d, for each NOT null tree nodes N in depth d-1, create two tree nodes with value v as N's left subtree root and right subtree root. And N's original left subtree should be the left subtree of the new left subtree root, its original right subtree should be the right subtree of the new right subtree root. If depth d is 1 that means there is no depth d-1 at all, then create a tree node with value v as the new root of the whole original tree, and the original tree is the new root's left subtree.

Example 1:

Input: 
A binary tree as following:
       4
     /   \
    2     6
   / \   / 
  3   1 5   

v = 1

d = 2

Output: 
       4
      / \
     1   1
    /     \
   2       6
  / \     / 
 3   1   5   

Example 2:

Input: 
A binary tree as following:
      4
     /   
    2    
   / \   
  3   1    

v = 1

d = 3

Output: 
      4
     /   
    2
   / \    
  1   1
 /     \  
3       1

Note:

    The given d is in range [1, maximum depth of the given tree + 1].
    The given binary tree has at least one tree node.

582. Kill Process
-----------------


Given n processes, each process has a unique PID (process id) and its PPID (parent process id).

Each process only has one parent process, but may have one or more children processes. This is just like a tree structure. Only one process has PPID that is 0, which means this process has no parent process. All the PIDs will be distinct positive integers.

We use two list of integers to represent a list of processes, where the first list contains PID for each process and the second list contains the corresponding PPID.

Now given the two lists, and a PID representing a process you want to kill, return a list of PIDs of processes that will be killed in the end. You should assume that when a process is killed, all its children processes will be killed. No order is required for the final answer.

Example 1:

Input: 
pid =  [1, 3, 10, 5]
ppid = [3, 0, 5, 3]
kill = 5
Output: [5,10]
Explanation: 
           3
         /   \
        1     5
             /
            10
Kill 5 will also kill 10.
Note:

The given kill id is guaranteed to be one of the given PIDs.
n >= 1.
题目大意：
给定n个进程，进程ID为PID，父进程ID为PPID。

当杀死一个进程时，其子进程也会被杀死。

给定进程列表和其对应的父进程列表，以及被杀死的进程ID，求所有被杀死的进程ID。

注意：

给定被杀死的进程ID一定在进程列表之中
n >= 1
解题思路：
树的层次遍历

利用孩子表示法建立进程树

然后从被杀死的进程号开始，执行层次遍历。


549. Binary Tree Longest Consecutive Sequence II
------------------------------------------------


Given a binary tree, you need to find the length of Longest Consecutive Path in Binary Tree.

Especially, this path can be either increasing or decreasing. For example, [1,2,3,4] and [4,3,2,1] are both considered valid, but the path [1,2,4,3] is not valid. On the other hand, the path can be in the child-Parent-child order, where not necessarily be parent-child order.

Example 1:

Input:
        1
       / \
      2   3
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest consecutive path is [1, 2] or [2, 1].
Example 2:

Input:
        2
       / \
      1   3
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest consecutive path is [1, 2, 3] or [3, 2, 1].
题目大意：
给定二叉树，寻找其中最长的连续的整数路径。

特别的，路径可以递增/递减。例如[1,2,3,4] 和 [4,3,2,1]均有效，但是 [1,2,4,3] 无效。另外，路径的顺序不一定必须是父亲-孩子，也可以是孩子-父亲-孩子。

545. Boundary of Binary Tree
----------------------------

Given a binary tree, return the values of its boundary in anti-clockwise direction starting from root. Boundary includes left boundary, leaves, and right boundary in order without duplicate nodes.

Left boundary is defined as the path from root to the left-most node. Right boundary is defined as the path from root to the right-most node. If the root doesn't have left subtree or right subtree, then the root itself is left boundary or right boundary. Note this definition only applies to the input binary tree, and not applies to any subtrees.

The left-most node is defined as a leaf node you could reach when you always firstly travel to the left subtree if exists. If not, travel to the right subtree. Repeat until you reach a leaf node.

The right-most node is also defined by the same way with left and right exchanged.

Example 1

Input:
  1
   \
    2
   / \
  3   4

Ouput:
[1, 3, 4, 2]

Explanation:
The root doesn't have left subtree, so the root itself is left boundary.
The leaves are node 3 and 4.
The right boundary are node 1,2,4. Note the anti-clockwise direction means you should output reversed right boundary.
So order them in anti-clockwise without duplicates and we have [1,3,4,2].
Example 2
::

        Input:
            ____1_____
           /          \
          2            3
         / \          / 
        4   5        6   
           / \      / \
          7   8    9  10  
       
        Ouput:
        [1,2,4,7,8,9,10,6,3]

Explanation:
The left boundary are node 1,2,4. (4 is the left-most node according to definition)
The leaves are node 4,7,8,9,10.
The right boundary are node 1,3,6,10. (10 is the right-most node).
So order them in anti-clockwise without duplicate nodes we have [1,2,4,7,8,9,10,6,3].
题目大意：
给定二叉树，逆时针输出二叉树的边界。边界包括左边界、叶子节点和右边界。

左边界是指从根出发到最左侧节点经过的路径。右边界是指从根出发到最右侧节点经过的路径。

如果根节点不包含左子树或者右子树，则对应的边界不存在。注意此定义是指整棵二叉树，不包含子树。

最左侧节点是指从根节点出发尽量向左走，如果不能则向右走，到达的叶子结点。

最右侧节点定义参考最左侧节点，左右互换即可。

解题思路：
左边界、右边界根据题意求解。叶子节点通过先序遍历得到。



536. Construct Binary Tree from String
--------------------------------------


You need to construct a binary tree from a string consisting of parenthesis and integers.

The whole input represents a binary tree. It contains an integer followed by zero, one or two pairs of parenthesis. The integer represents the root's value and a pair of parenthesis contains a child binary tree with the same structure.

You always start to construct the left child node of the parent first if it exists.

Example:

Input: "4(2(3)(1))(6(5))"
Output: return the tree root node representing the following tree:

       4
     /   \
    2     6
   / \   / 
  3   1 5   
Note:

There will only be '(', ')', '-' and '0' ~ '9' in the input string.
题目大意：
根据字符串重构二叉树。

输入包含数字和括号，数字代表根节点，括号内的子串代表左、右孩子。

注意：

输入字符串只包含'(', ')，'-'和数字'0'-'9'

解题思路：
递归+字符串处理

通过括号匹配将字符串拆解成root, (left), (right)三部分，递归创建二叉树



515. Find Largest Value in Each Tree Row
----------------------------------------

You need to find the largest value in each row of a binary tree.

Example:

Input: 

          1
         / \
        3   2
       / \   \  
      5   3   9 

Output: [1, 3, 9]


513. Find Bottom Left Tree Value
--------------------------------



 Given a binary tree, find the leftmost value in the last row of the tree.

Example 1:

Input:

    2
   / \
  1   3

Output:
1

Example 2:

Input:

        1
       / \
      2   3
     /   / \
    4   5   6
       /
      7

Output:
7

Note: You may assume the tree (i.e., the given root node) is not NULL. 



508. Most Frequent Subtree Sum
------------------------------


 Given the root of a tree, you are asked to find the most frequent subtree sum. The subtree sum of a node is defined as the sum of all the node values formed by the subtree rooted at that node (including the node itself). So what is the most frequent subtree sum value? If there is a tie, return all the values with the highest frequency in any order.

Examples 1
Input:

  5
 /  \
2   -3

return [2, -3, 4], since all the values happen only once, return all of them in any order.

Examples 2
Input:

  5
 /  \
2   -5

return [2], since 2 happens twice, however -5 only occur once.

Note: You may assume the sum of values in any subtree is in the range of 32-bit signed integer. 


450. Delete Node in a BST
-------------------------

Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

    Search for a node to remove.
    If the node is found, delete the node.

Note: Time complexity should be O(height of tree).

Example:

root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
key = 3

    5
   / \
  3   6
 / \   \
2   4   7

Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.

One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the following BST.

    5
   / \
  4   6
 /     \
2       7

Another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7].

    5
   / \
  2   6
   \   \
    4   7



449. Serialize and Deserialize BST
----------------------------------

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary search tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

The encoded string should be as compact as possible.

Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.


337. House Robber III
---------------------

 The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:

     3
    / \
   2   3
    \   \ 
     3   1

Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.

Example 2:

     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \   \ 
 1   3   1

Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.

366. Find Leaves of Binary Tree
-------------------------------

Given a binary tree, find all leaves and then remove those leaves. Then repeat the previous steps until the tree is empty.

Example:
Given binary tree 
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    
Returns [4, 5, 3], [2], [1].

Explanation:
1. Remove the leaves [4, 5, 3] from the tree

          1
         / 
        2          
2. Remove the leaf [2] from the tree

          1          
3. Remove the leaf [1] from the tree

          []         
Returns [4, 5, 3], [2], [1].

这道题给了我们一个二叉树，让我们返回其每层的叶节点，就像剥洋葱一样，将这个二叉树一层一层剥掉，最后一个剥掉根节点。那么题目中提示说要用DFS来做，思路是这样的，每一个节点从左子节点和右子节点分开走可以得到两个深度，由于成为叶节点的条件是左右子节点都为空，所以我们取左右子节点中较大值加1为当前节点的深度值，知道了深度值就可以将节点值加入到结果res中的正确位置了，求深度的方法我们可以参见Maximum Depth of Binary Tree中求最大深度的方法，参见代码如下：



298. Binary Tree Longest Consecutive Sequence
---------------------------------------------

Given a binary tree, find the length of the longest consecutive sequence path.

The path refers to any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The longest consecutive path need to be from parent to child (cannot be the reverse).

For example,

   1
    \
     3
    / \
   2   4
        \
         5
Longest consecutive sequence path is 3-4-5, so return 3.

   2
    \
     3
    /
   2    
  /
 1
Longest consecutive sequence path is 2-3',not3-2-1', so return `2'.




285. Inorder Successor in BST
-----------------------------

Given a binary search tree and a node in it, find the in-order successor of that node in the BST.

Note: If the given node has no in-order successor in the tree, return null.

 

这道题让我们求二叉搜索树的某个节点的中序后继节点，那么我们根据BST的性质知道其中序遍历的结果是有序的， 是我最先用的方法是用迭代的中序遍历方法，然后用一个bool型的变量b，初始化为false，我们进行中序遍历，对于遍历到的节点，我们首先看如果此时b已经为true，说明之前遍历到了p，那么此时我们返回当前节点，如果b仍为false，我们看遍历到的节点和p是否相同，如果相同，我们此时将b赋为true，那么下一个遍历到的节点就能返回了，参见代码如下：




255. Verify Preorder Sequence in Binary Search Tree
---------------------------------------------------


Given an array of numbers, verify whether it is the correct preorder traversal sequence of a binary search tree.
You may assume each number in the sequence is unique.
Follow up:
Could you do it using only constant space complexity?
Brute-force solution:
The idea to solve the problem is: a[0] must be the root of the BST. Then we start from index 1 and iterate until a number which is greater than root, mark as i. All the numbers less than i must be less than root, number greater than i must be greater than root. Then we can recursively validate the BST.


先复习一下BST，给定一个节点，其左子树的所有节点都小于该节点，右子树的所有节点都大于该节点；preorder序列是指在遍历该BST的时候，先记录根节点，再遍历左子树，然后遍历右子树；所以一个preorder序列有这样一个特点，左子树的序列必定都在右子树的序列之前；并且左子树的序列必定都小于根节点，右子树的序列都大于根节点；
根据上面的特点很容易通过递归的方式完成：
如果序列只有一个元素，那么肯定是正确的，对应只有一个节点的树；
如果多于一个元素，以当前节点为根节点；并从当前节点向后遍历，直到大于根节点的节点出现（或者到尾巴），那么根节点之后，该大节点之前的，是左子树；该大节点及之后的组成右子树；递归判断左右子树即可；
那么什么时候一个序列肯定不是一个preorder序列呢？前面得到的右子树，如果在其中出现了比根节点还小的数，那么就可以直接返回false了；



250. Count Univalue Subtrees
----------------------------


Given a binary tree, count the number of uni-value subtrees.

A Uni-value subtree means all nodes of the subtree have the same value.

For example:
Given binary tree,

              5
             / \
            1   5
           / \   \
          5   5   5
 

return 4.

 

这道题让我们求相同值子树的个数，就是所有节点值都相同的子树的个数，之前有道求最大BST子树的题Largest BST Subtree，感觉挺像的，都是关于子树的问题，解题思路也可以参考一下，我们可以用递归来做，第一种解法的思路是先序遍历树的所有的节点，然后对每一个节点调用判断以当前节点为根的字数的所有节点是否相同，判断方法可以参考之前那题Same Tree，用的是分治法的思想，分别对左右字数分别调用递归，参见代码如下：




156. Binary Tree Upside Down
----------------------------

Given a binary tree where all the right nodes are either leaf nodes with a sibling (a left node that shares the same parent node) or empty, flip it upside down and turn it into a tree where the original right nodes turned into left leaf nodes. Return the new root.
For example:
Given a binary tree {1,2,3,4,5},
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \
4   5
return the root of the binary tree [4,5,2,#,#,3,1].
   4
  / \
 5   2
    / \
   3   1  





236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
--------------------------------------------



Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

        _______3______
       /              \
    ___5__          ___1__
   /      \        /      \
   6      _2       0       8
         /  \
         7   4

For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 5 and 1 is 3. Another example is LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.




230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST
----------------------------------



Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.

Note:
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.

Follow up:
What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?

222. Count Complete Tree Nodes
------------------------------

Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.





199. Binary Tree Right Side View
--------------------------------


Given a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the right side of it, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.

For example:
Given the following binary tree,

   1            <---
 /   \
2     3         <---
 \     \
  5     4       <---

You should return [1, 3, 4].

173. Binary Search Tree Iterator
--------------------------------


Implement an iterator over a binary search tree (BST). Your iterator will be initialized with the root node of a BST.

Calling next() will return the next smallest number in the BST.

Note: next() and hasNext() should run in average O(1) time and uses O(h) memory, where h is the height of the tree.

144. Binary Tree Preorder Traversal
-----------------------------------


Given a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

For example:
Given binary tree {1,#,2,3},

   1
    \
     2
    /
   3

return [1,2,3].

Note: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?




129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers
-----------------------------


Given a binary tree containing digits from 0-9 only, each root-to-leaf path could represent a number.

An example is the root-to-leaf path 1->2->3 which represents the number 123.

Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

For example,

    1
   / \
  2   3

The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.

Return the sum = 12 + 13 = 25. 


117. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II
---------------------------------------------------


Follow up for problem "Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node".

What if the given tree could be any binary tree? Would your previous solution still work?

Note:

    You may only use constant extra space.

For example,
Given the following binary tree,

         1
       /  \
      2    3
     / \    \
    4   5    7

After calling your function, the tree should look like:

         1 -> NULL
       /  \
      2 -> 3 -> NULL
     / \    \
    4-> 5 -> 7 -> NULL


116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node
------------------------------------------------



 Given a binary tree

    struct TreeLinkNode {
      TreeLinkNode *left;
      TreeLinkNode *right;
      TreeLinkNode *next;
    }

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.

Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.

Note:

    You may only use constant extra space.
    You may assume that it is a perfect binary tree (ie, all leaves are at the same level, and every parent has two children).

For example,
Given the following perfect binary tree,

         1
       /  \
      2    3
     / \  / \
    4  5  6  7

After calling your function, the tree should look like:

         1 -> NULL
       /  \
      2 -> 3 -> NULL
     / \  / \
    4->5->6->7 -> NULL




114. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List
---------------------------------------


 Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.

For example,
Given

         1
        / \
       2   5
      / \   \
     3   4   6

The flattened tree should look like:

   1
    \
     2
      \
       3
        \
         4
          \
           5
            \
             6

click to show hints.
Hints:

If you notice carefully in the flattened tree, each node's right child points to the next node of a pre-order traversal.


113. Path Sum II
----------------


 Given a binary tree and a sum, find all root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals the given sum.
For example:
Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,

              5
             / \
            4   8
           /   / \
          11  13  4
         /  \    / \
        7    2  5   1

return

[
   [5,4,11,2],
   [5,8,4,5]
]



106. Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal
---------------------------------------------------------------



Given inorder and postorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

Note:
You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree. 



105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal
--------------------------------------------------------------

Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

Note:
You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree. 




103. Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal
---------------------------------------------


Given a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

For example:
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7

return its zigzag level order traversal as:

[
  [3],
  [20,9],
  [15,7]
]



102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
--------------------------------------

Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

For example:
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7

return its level order traversal as:

[
  [3],
  [9,20],
  [15,7]
]



98. Validate Binary Search Tree
-------------------------------



 Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

    The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
    The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
    Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Example 1:

    2
   / \
  1   3

Binary tree [2,1,3], return true.

Example 2:

    1
   / \
  2   3

Binary tree [1,2,3], return false. 




96. Unique Binary Search Trees
------------------------------


Given n, how many structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1...n?

For example,
Given n = 3, there are a total of 5 unique BST's.

   1         3     3      2      1
    \       /     /      / \      \
     3     2     1      1   3      2
    /     /       \                 \
   2     1         2                 3


95. Unique Binary Search Trees II
---------------------------------

Given an integer n, generate all structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1...n.

For example,
Given n = 3, your program should return all 5 unique BST's shown below.

   1         3     3      2      1
    \       /     /      / \      \
     3     2     1      1   3      2
    /     /       \                 \
   2     1         2                 3



94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal
---------------------------------


Given a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

For example:
Given binary tree [1,null,2,3],

   1
    \
     2
    /
   3

return [1,3,2].

Note: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
