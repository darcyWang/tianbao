645. Set Mismatch
-----------------



 The set S originally contains numbers from 1 to n. But unfortunately, due to the data error, one of the numbers in the set got duplicated to another number in the set, which results in repetition of one number and loss of another number.

Given an array nums representing the data status of this set after the error. Your task is to firstly find the number occurs twice and then find the number that is missing. Return them in the form of an array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,2,4]
Output: [2,3]

Note:

    The given array size will in the range [2, 10000].
    The given array's numbers won't have any order.


633. Sum of Square Numbers
--------------------------

 Given a non-negative integer c, your task is to decide whether there're two integers a and b such that a2 + b2 = c.

Example 1:

Input: 5
Output: True
Explanation: 1 * 1 + 2 * 2 = 5

Example 2:

Input: 3
Output: False



628. Maximum Product of Three Numbers 
-------------------------------------

Given an integer array, find three numbers whose product is maximum and output the maximum product.

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3]
Output: 6

Example 2:

Input: [1,2,3,4]
Output: 24

Note:

    The length of the given array will be in range [3,104] and all elements are in the range [-1000, 1000].
    Multiplication of any three numbers in the input won't exceed the range of 32-bit signed integer.


598. Range Addition II 
----------------------

Given an m * n matrix M initialized with all 0's and several update operations.

Operations are represented by a 2D array, and each operation is represented by an array with two positive integers a and b, which means M[i][j] should be added by one for all 0 <= i < a and 0 <= j < b.

You need to count and return the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations.

Example 1:

Input: 
m = 3, n = 3
operations = [[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
Initially, M = 
[[0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0]]

After performing [2,2], M = 
[[1, 1, 0],
 [1, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 0]]

After performing [3,3], M = 
[[2, 2, 1],
 [2, 2, 1],
 [1, 1, 1]]

So the maximum integer in M is 2, and there are four of it in M. So return 4.

Note:

    The range of m and n is [1,40000].
    The range of a is [1,m], and the range of b is [1,n].
    The range of operations size won't exceed 10,000.


507. Perfect Number 
-------------------

We define the Perfect Number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of all its positive divisors except itself.
Now, given an integer n, write a function that returns true when it is a perfect number and false when it is not.

Example:

Input: 28
Output: True
Explanation: 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14

Note: The input number n will not exceed 100,000,000. (1e8) 


453. Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements
------------------------------------------


Given a non-empty integer array of size n, find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing n - 1 elements by 1.

Example:

Input:
[1,2,3]

Output:
3

Explanation:
Only three moves are needed (remember each move increments two elements):

[1,2,3]  =>  [2,3,3]  =>  [3,4,3]  =>  [4,4,4]




441. Arranging Coins 
--------------------


You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.

Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.

n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

Example 1:

n = 5

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.

Example 2:

n = 8

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.



415. Add Strings
----------------


Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2.

Note:

    The length of both num1 and num2 is < 5100.
    Both num1 and num2 contains only digits 0-9.
    Both num1 and num2 does not contain any leading zero.
    You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.



400. Nth Digit
--------------

Find the nth digit of the infinite integer sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ...

Note:
n is positive and will fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer (n < 231).

Example 1:

Input:
3

Output:
3

Example 2:

Input:
11

Output:
0

Explanation:
The 11th digit of the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ... is a 0, which is part of the number 10.


367. Valid Perfect Square 
-------------------------

Given a positive integer num, write a function which returns True if num is a perfect square else False.

Note: Do not use any built-in library function such as sqrt.

Example 1:

Input: 16
Returns: True

Example 2:

Input: 14
Returns: False

268. Missing Number 
-------------------


 Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

For example,
Given nums = [0, 1, 3] return 2.

Note:
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?

263. Ugly Number
----------------

 Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. For example, 6, 8 are ugly while 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7.

Note that 1 is typically treated as an ugly number.

258. Add Digits
---------------


 Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.

For example:

Given num = 38, the process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. Since 2 has only one digit, return it.

Follow up:
Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime? 



246. Strobogrammatic Number
---------------------------

 A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).

Write a function to determine if a number is strobogrammatic. The number is represented as a string.

For example, the numbers "69", "88", and "818" are all strobogrammatic.

注意到0-9中有五个数字满足这种“镜像对称”，所以我们将它们放在一个哈希表中，然后遍历num中的前一半字符（包括最中间的字符），一旦发现某字符不在哈希表中，或者虽然是，但是在后面的对应位置上的字符不是它的“镜像对称”字符，就返回false。如果检查完所有的字符都没有问题，则返回true。

202. Happy Number 
-----------------

Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example: 19 is a happy number

    12 + 92 = 82
    82 + 22 = 68
    62 + 82 = 100
    12 + 02 + 02 = 1

13. Roman to Integer 
--------------------
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.


9. Palindrome Number 
--------------------

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.

Some hints:

Could negative integers be palindromes? (ie, -1)

If you are thinking of converting the integer to string, note the restriction of using extra space.

You could also try reversing an integer. However, if you have solved the problem "Reverse Integer", you know that the reversed integer might overflow. How would you handle such case?

There is a more generic way of solving this problem.



7. Reverse Integer 
------------------


Reverse digits of an integer.

Example1: x = 123, return 321
Example2: x = -123, return -321

click to show spoilers.
Have you thought about this?

Here are some good questions to ask before coding. Bonus points for you if you have already thought through this!

If the integer's last digit is 0, what should the output be? ie, cases such as 10, 100.

Did you notice that the reversed integer might overflow? Assume the input is a 32-bit integer, then the reverse of 1000000003 overflows. How should you handle such cases?

For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

Note:
The input is assumed to be a 32-bit signed integer. Your function should return 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
