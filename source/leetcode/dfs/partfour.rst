210. Course Schedule II
-----------------------
 There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.

There may be multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.

For example:

2, [[1,0]]

There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1]

4, [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]

There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0. So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is[0,2,1,3].

Note:

    The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
    You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

Hints:

    This problem is equivalent to finding the topological order in a directed graph. If a cycle exists, no topological ordering exists and therefore it will be impossible to take all courses.

    Topological sort could also be done via BFS.


207. Course Schedule
--------------------

 There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

For example:

2, [[1,0]]

There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

2, [[1,0],[0,1]]

There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

Note:

    The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
    You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

200. Number of Islands
----------------------

Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

Example 1:

11110
11010
11000
00000

Answer: 1

Example 2:

11000
11000
00100
00011

Answer: 3

199. Binary Tree Right Side View
--------------------------------


Given a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the right side of it, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.

For example:
Given the following binary tree,

   1            <---
 /   \
2     3         <---
 \     \
  5     4       <---

You should return [1, 3, 4].

133. Clone Graph
----------------

 Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors.

OJ's undirected graph serialization:

Nodes are labeled uniquely.
We use # as a separator for each node, and , as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.

As an example, consider the serialized graph {0,1,2#1,2#2,2}.

The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by #.

    First node is labeled as 0. Connect node 0 to both nodes 1 and 2.
    Second node is labeled as 1. Connect node 1 to node 2.
    Third node is labeled as 2. Connect node 2 to node 2 (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.

Visually, the graph looks like the following:

       1
      / \
     /   \
    0 --- 2
         / \
         \_/


129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers
-----------------------------

Given a binary tree containing digits from 0-9 only, each root-to-leaf path could represent a number.

An example is the root-to-leaf path 1->2->3 which represents the number 123.

Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

For example,

    1
   / \
  2   3

The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.

Return the sum = 12 + 13 = 25. 



117. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II
---------------------------------------------------

Follow up for problem "Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node".

What if the given tree could be any binary tree? Would your previous solution still work?

Note:

    You may only use constant extra space.

For example,
Given the following binary tree,

         1
       /  \
      2    3
     / \    \
    4   5    7

After calling your function, the tree should look like:

         1 -> NULL
       /  \
      2 -> 3 -> NULL
     / \    \
    4-> 5 -> 7 -> NULL



116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node
------------------------------------------------

 Given a binary tree

    struct TreeLinkNode {
      TreeLinkNode *left;
      TreeLinkNode *right;
      TreeLinkNode *next;
    }

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.

Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.

Note:

    You may only use constant extra space.
    You may assume that it is a perfect binary tree (ie, all leaves are at the same level, and every parent has two children).

For example,
Given the following perfect binary tree,

         1
       /  \
      2    3
     / \  / \
    4  5  6  7

After calling your function, the tree should look like:

         1 -> NULL
       /  \
      2 -> 3 -> NULL
     / \  / \
    4->5->6->7 -> NULL




114. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List
---------------------------------------



 Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.

For example,
Given

         1
        / \
       2   5
      / \   \
     3   4   6

The flattened tree should look like:

   1
    \
     2
      \
       3
        \
         4
          \
           5
            \
             6

click to show hints.
Hints:

If you notice carefully in the flattened tree, each node's right child points to the next node of a pre-order traversal.







109. Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree
----------------------------------------------

Given a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.





106. Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal
---------------------------------------------------------------


Given inorder and postorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

Note:
You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree. 




105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal
--------------------------------------------------------------


Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

Note:
You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree. 



98. Validate Binary Search Tree
-------------------------------


 Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

    The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
    The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
    Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Example 1:

    2
   / \
  1   3

Binary tree [2,1,3], return true.

Example 2:

    1
   / \
  2   3

Binary tree [1,2,3], return false.
